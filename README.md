# Mouse Fast Scroll extension for Visual Studio 2012+

This fork aims to provide an uniform Fast Scroll experience with Visual Studio Code.

Feature changes to the original [MouseFastScroll](https://github.com/tunnelvisionlabs/MouseFastScroll) extension:

+ Doesn't change behavior of Ctrl modifier key
+ Doesn't bother smooth scrolling (triggered by devices like precision touchpads, Surface Precision Mouse)
+ Uses left Alt as modifier key to fast scroll
+ Uses right Alt as modifier key to scroll by pages
